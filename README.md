# NUBC automation
## UBC reporting template to automate reports for the New to UBC (NUBC) survey
This project has code to automate the reporting process for the NUBC survey dataset. 'plotmaker.R' is the script file that holds the code for processing NUBC 2021 data, and the RMarkdown file 'funtion_test.Rmd' generates a document with graphs and tables.
